what is the binary tree algorithm for creating mazes?

basically, we pick an arbitrary cell to begin working our way through the maze.
we choose between creating a link between the northern cell or the eastern cell.
we visit each of the cells and make the choice between north or east.
this algorithm has the bias that if we are on the eastern wall, we cannot carve east,
and if we are not the northern wall, we cannot carve north.
we continue this process until we have visited all the cells in the grid.

what is the sidewinder algorihm for creating mazes?

the sidewinder is similar to the binary tree algorithm, but it has a strong preference
for beginning on the western wall of the grid. it tries to group cells together before
carving any kind of northern passageway. each cell we visit, the choice is between 
linking the current cell and the eastern neighbor or choosing between one of the current cells
and its neighbors and carving north in one of them. the cluster of cells of the current
cell and its neighbors is called the run of cells. erasing one of the run's northern walls
is called closing the run.
